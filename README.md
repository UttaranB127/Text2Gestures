# Text2Gestures: A Transformer-Based Network for Generating Emotive Body Gestures for Virtual Agents

---
**DEPRECATION WARNING**

This network has known stability issues on convergence while training. We highly recommend using our newer and stabler implementation, available at [UttaranB127/speech2affective_gestures](https://github.com/UttaranB127/speech2affective_gestures).

## Installation
Our scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with
- Python 3.7
- Cuda 10.2
- cudNN 7.6.5
- PyTorch 1.5

1. Clone this repository.

We use $BASE to refer to the base directory for this project (the directory containing `main.py`). Change present working directory to $BASE.

2. [Optional but recommended] Create a conda envrionment for the project and activate it.

```
conda create t2g-env python=3.7
conda activate t2g-env
```

3. Install the package requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: You might need to manually uninstall and reinstall `matplotlib` and `kiwisolver` for them to work.

4. Install PyTorch following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/).
Note: You might need to manually uninstall and reinstall `numpy` for `torch` to work.

## Downloading the datasets
1. The original dataset is available for download [here](http://ebmdb.tuebingen.mpg.de/), but the samples need to be downloaded individually.

We have scraped the full dataset and made it available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhnC-puHTh0ax8hyq00Yfny2GK_Nz--k/view?usp=sharing).

2. If downloading from our anonymous link, unzip the downloaded file to a directorty named "data", located at the same level at the project root (i.e., the project root and the data are sibling directories).

3. We also use the NRC-VAD lexicon to obtain the VAD representations of the words in the text. It can be downloaded from the [original web page](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html), or directly using [this link](https://saifmohammad.com/WebDocs/VAD/NRC-VAD-Lexicon-Aug2018Release.zip). Unzip the downloaded zip file in the same "data" directory.

## Running the code
Run the `main.py` file with the appropriate command line arguments.
```
python main.py <args list>
```

The full list of arguments is available inside `main.py`.

For any argument not specificed in the command line, the code uses the default value for that argument.

On running `main.py`, the code will train the network and generate sample gestures post-training.

We also provide a pretrained model for download at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-i4dPMxz38bJOU41c8jDmkiiESqZV5-W/view?usp=sharing). If using this model, save it inside the directory `$BASE/models/mpi` (create the directory if it does not exist). Set the command-line argument `--train` to `False` to skip training and use this model directly for evaluation. The generated samples are stored in the automatically created `render` directory. We generate all the 145 test samples by deafult and also store the corresponding ground truth samples for comparison. We have tested that the samples, stored in `.bvh` files, are compatible with blender.
